# KEYS
A Powder Toy element for detecting keypresses, modified from [boxmein's KSNS element]

## Installation
Probably the best way to use this is to download [Jacob1's Mod] and add this repository (or just KEYS.lua) to the scripts folder

You can also open the console (~) and enter ```dofile("path/to/KEYS.lua")```

Lastly, you can make it the autorun file:
 - Download ```KEYS.lua``` and move it to TPT's data folder, found by entering the options menu (checkmark) and clicking "Open Data Folder".
 - Rename ```KEYS.lua``` to ```autorun.lua```
